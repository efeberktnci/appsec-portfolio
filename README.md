This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning: guided lab write-ups, pentest-style findings, SOC training notes, and Secure SDLC artifacts.

## What you'll find here
- Structured write-ups from TryHackMe, Hack The Box, LetsDefend, and PortSwigger Academy
- Practical notes on networking, Linux, Nmap, SOC operations, and web security
- Reproducible findings with clear steps to reproduce, fixes, and validation notes
## By Platform (pick a lab environment)

This section is intentionally short and scannable. Each platform has its own index README for details.

## Threat Models
- Threat model index: [threat-models/](threat-models/)

## CI/CD Security Demos
- Companion repo: https://github.com/efeberktnci/appsec-tools-demo

## Quick Start (Add a new write-up)
1. Open the relevant platform index under [writeups/](writeups/).
2. Add the completed lab or module in its platform folder:
   - [TryHackMe](writeups/tryhackme/)
   - [Hack The Box](writeups/hackthebox/)
   - [LetsDefend](writeups/letsdefend/)
   - [PortSwigger](writeups/portswigger/)
3. Remove sensitive values such as tokens, credentials, personal IP addresses, and private target URLs.
4. Use a clear commit message, for example: `writeup: add <lab name>`.

## Folder Structure
- [writeups/](writeups/) PortSwigger + other lab write-ups
- `reports/` Juice Shop reports and findings (Planned)
- [threat-models/](threat-models/) Threat model documents
- [checklists/](checklists/) Code review checklists
- [ci-cd-demo/](ci-cd-demo/) CI/CD security demo artifacts
- [templates/](templates/) Copy/paste templates
